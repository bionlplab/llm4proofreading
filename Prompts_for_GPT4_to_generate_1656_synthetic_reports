</Report Template>

You are a radiologist assistant helping to create synthetic reports using the <Report Template> above.

Please follow instructions carefully, and only output what is expected below and nothing more.

Radiology reports can have a variety of errors and issues. 'Common Errors' between 'Findings' and 'Impression' sections: [interval change errors, left/right errors, negation errors, and gender discrepancies]. There may also be grammatical errors or other mistakes that are out of place given the context of the findings of the report.

Left/right error examples:
- [Findings] Possible right upper lobe consolidation.
[Impression] Possible left upper lobe consolidation, consider pneumonia or tuberculosis.
- [Findings] Possible rib fracture on the right.
[Impression] Possible left-sided rib fracture.

Interval change error examples:
- [Findings] Lungs/Airways/Pleura: Unilateral lower lobe consolidation, consistent with pneumonia.
[Impression] Bilateral pneumonia.
- [Findings] Lungs/Airways/Pleura: Emphysematous changes are noted with decreased lung volumes.
[Impression] Lung volumes increased in size.

Negation error examples:
- [Findings] There is evidence of emphysema
[Impression] No evidence of emphysema.
- [Findings] Appendicitis is not seen
[Impression] Appendicitis is seen.

Most reports are transcribed by the automatic speech recognition (ASR) system and may result in transcription errors with words that might sound similar to a medical term. Some of these are single words and some may be multi-word terms. Examples:
- 'chloral effusion' should be 'pleural effusion'
- 'costal phrenic' should be 'costophrenic'

{Clinical Conditions}
- Aortic enlargement
- Atelectasis
- Cardiomegaly
- Atherosclerotic Calcification
- Clavicle fracture
- Consolidation
- Edema
- Emphysema
- Enlarged pulmonary artery
- Interstitial lung disease (ILD)
- Infiltration
- Lung cavity
- Lung cyst
- Lung opacity
- Nodule/Mass
- Pulmonary fibrosis
- Pneumothorax
- Pleural thickening
- Pleural effusion
- Rib fracture
- Other lesion
- Lung tumor
- Pneumonia
- Tuberculosis
- COPD

Synthetic Report Formatting Rules:
- Words after a colon':' in the template and at the beginning of a new line should be capitalized, but not all capital letters.
- If there is more than one line in the 'Impression' please enumerate each line. A single line in the `Impression` should not be enumerated
- Do not reorder the report â€“ keep the template fields in the same order
- Do not show the output wrapped in the triple quotes

{Task 1 Instructions} Synthetic Report Generation
- Enumerate the 'Patient ID: []' using 5-digits with zero padding:
Patient ID: [00001]
- Format the 'History []' with patient age, gender, and one or more clinical conditions or symptoms like this. Use a variety of common and rare clinical conditions and symptoms that are appropriate for the modality in the 'Procedure []' field.
History: [64 M with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]
- For 'Findings: []' please come up with 1-4 positive and abnormal findings for each report. Please use {Clinical Conditions} as a reference to common conditions, but you are not limited to these to include in the report.
- For 'Impression: []' summarize the most important positive and abnormal findings. Minor abnormalities like 'atherosclerotic calcifications' in the aorta should not be included in the impression.

- For each Synthetic report, create a 'Synthetic Report With Errors' and inject one or more of the 'Common Errors' [interval change errors, left/right errors, negation errors, and gender discrepancies] or errors that you might see if you use ASR, like transcription errors with words that might sound similar to a medical term.

- Please encapsulate the inserted errors in the 'Synthetic Report With Errors' with <e error="error description"> </e> markup and the corresponding correct text in the original 'Synthetic Report'.
e.g., <e error="left/right error"> </e>,
<e error="negation error"> </e>,
<e error="transcription error"> </e>,
<e error="interval change error"> </e>

Please generate 828 reports using {Task 1 Instructions} - Use a markdown table format: [Report Number, Synthetic Report, Synthetic Report With Errors, Error Type(s)]
